# Big Mountain Resort Profit Recommendation

## Overview

Big Mountain Resort, a ski resort located in Montana. Big Mountain Resort
offers spectacular views of Glacier National Park and Flathead National Forest, with
access to 105 trails. Every year about 350,000 people ski or snowboard at Big Mountain.
This mountain can accommodate skiers and riders of all levels and abilities.
These are serviced by 11 lifts, 2 T-bars, and 1 magic carpet for novice skiers. The
longest run is named Hellfire and is 3.3 miles in length. The base elevation is 4,464 ft,
and the summit is 6,817 ft with a vertical drop of 2,353 ft.
Big Mountain Resort has recently installed an additional chair lift to help increase the
distribution of visitors across the mountain. This additional chair increases their
operating costs by $1,540,000 this season.
The resort's pricing strategy has been to charge a premium above the average price of
resorts in its market segment. They know there are limitations to this approach. There's
a suspicion that Big Mountain is not capitalizing on its facilities as much as it could.
Basing their pricing on just the market average does not provide the business with a
good sense of how important some facilities are compared to others. This hampers
investment strategy. The business wants some guidance on how to
select a better value for their ticket price. They are also considering a number of
changes that they hope will either cut costs without undermining the ticket price or will
support an even higher ticket price.

## Problem Statement

How can Big Mountain company maintain its annual profit margin at ``9.2%`` by increasing
ticket cost for both weekdays and weekends or increasing number of days of opening
or reducing the number of runs or reduce the total skiable area to reduce operation
cost?
